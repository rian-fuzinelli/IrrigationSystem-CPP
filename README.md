## ðŸŒŠ This project is an intelligent control of an irrigation monitoring system made through Arduino prototyping during the IoT module at university.

# Preview

- The Smart Irrigation Control project with Arduino aims to save water when watering plants. By using sensors to monitor soil moisture, the system only activates irrigation when necessary, preventing waste. This not only conserves water resources but also improves plant care and contributes to sustainability, making it an accessible solution for both large agricultural areas and urban gardens and vegetable patches.
### Components

- Arduino Uno R3: Controls the entire system, processing data and activating the devices.

-  Soil Moisture Sensor: Measures the soil moisture and sends the data to the Arduino.

-  Temperature Sensor (TMP36): Measures the ambient temperature to assist in irrigation control.

-  DC Motor (Water Pump): Activated by the Arduino to irrigate the soil when necessary.

-  LCD 16x2: Displays information such as soil moisture, temperature, and system status.

-  Piezo (Buzzer): Emits sound alerts in case of low humidity or system failure.

-  Potentiometer: Adjusts the sensitivity level of the soil moisture.

-  Resistors: Protect the components and ensure the proper functioning of the circuit.

-  Small Breadboard: Used to connect all the components without the need for soldering
